# WASM

See this WASM Demo running in the browser https://yatter.itch.io/sdl2wasm

## Introduction

We wanted to animate some webpage banners, similar to how we used to do it in Flash, which is no longer supported.

The solution, of course, is WASM - WebAssembly - which is supported by all the major browsers.

This repo is a work in progress, however you can see it working at the above link.

It was written in C++ using SDL2 and compiled using emscripten.

_It also runs on the desktop as an application!_

Deployment to the above link was easy, we just went `make wasm`, and that produced four files, `hello.html`, `hello.js`, `hello.wasm`, and `hello.data`, we then renamed the hello.html file to index.html, zipped them all up, and uploaded the zip file to our itch.io account!

## Setup

The following is our own aide memoire to ourselves so that we can remember what we did, hopefully we will reformat it into a tutorial when we get the time.

You'll notice in the resources folder that there are both .bmp files and .png files. The reason for this is that the library setup for .png files for SDL2 can be tricky, yet BMPs run out of the box.

Similarly, you will see that the load font method is commented out - although we could compile them for an app, we couldn't get the compiler paths right for the WASM build, so we just loaded the text as an image instead. Yup, a pretty good hack for the moment.

Hopefully there are enough tips below to get a running start!

## Platform

The following setup is for MacOS, which we use for outputting to Mac, iOS, and Android. As WASM is platform independant, WASM produced on MacOS is also suitable for Windows deployments. We don't currently have any guides for building SDL2 and creating WASM from it, using Windows.

## Makefile Aide Memoire

- `make wasm` builds the WASM in build/debug and outputs `hello.html`, `hello.js`, `hello.wasm`, and `hello.data`
- `make wasmrun` runs up a server in the current directory, go to `localhost:8000` in a browser, click on build, then hello.html
- `make app` builds the app in build/debug and outputs an executable called `application`
- `make apprun` runs up the application at `build/debug/application` and which should appear in it's own window
- `make tree` outputs your directory tree, useful for finding out how the includes and libs are symlinked.
- `make clean` cleans the build/debug folder of any WASM or App files that were generated using the commands above.

## Tree

Depending upon your symlinks, it should look something like the following:

```

## Command Lines Aide Memoire

Don't be daunted by these command lines, the first three are automatically generated by the Makefile. They are, however, interesting to look at!

The bottom three, however, you will use, the first of them to install tree, if you don't already have it; the seecond of them to find the paths of already installed packages; and the third of them to look at your tree.

- `em++ src/main.cpp -std=c++17 -O3 -s WASM=1 -s USE_SDL=2 -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2 -s USE_LIBPNG=1 -lsdl2 -lsdl2_image -lz -lpng16 -Iinclude -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/include -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.16/include/SDL2 -I/opt/homebrew/opt/zlib/include -Llib -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libpng/1.6.37/lib -o build/debug/hello.html --shell-file template.html --preload-file ./resources` - the current make wasm command line
- `g++ src/main.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall -O0 -g -lsdl2 -lsdl2_image -Iinclude -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_image/2.0.5/include -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2/2.0.16/include/SDL2 -Llib -L/opt/homebrew/lib -o build/debug/application` - the current make app command line
- `python3 -m http.server` - kicks up an HTTP Server on port 8000 in the current directory, `make wasmrun` calls this! If this does not work, try `brew install python3`.
- `brew install tree` to get the tree command line.
- `pkg-config --libs sdl2` - this is used to find where the includes and libraries are for a particular library, this example shows SDL2
- `source ./emsdk_env.sh` - this is used to put the emscripten environmental variables in the path of the current terminal, just navigate tot where Emscriptem is installed, enter this command, and return to this project directory, and for example, run make.

## Checklist:

### zlib (needed for libpng, only needed for the WASM build)

- Check: `pkg-config --libs zlib`
- Example: `-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/zlib/1.2.11/lib -lz`
- Install: `brew install zlib`
- Reinstall `brew reinstall zlib`
- Upgrade: `brew upgrade zlib`
- Locate the include folder: To find the include, try going to the L directory above, and look for an include folder in the next higher directory.

### libpng (needed for SDL2_image WASM build)

- Check: `pkg-config --libs libpng`
- Example: `-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libpng/1.6.37/lib -lpng16 -lz`
- Install: `brew install libpng`
- Reinstall: `brew reinstall libpng`
- Upgrade: `brew upgrade libpng`
- Locate the include folder: To find the include, try going to the L directory above, and look for an include folder in the next higher directory.

### SDL2_image

- Check: `pkg-config --libs sdl2`
- Example: `-L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2`
- Install: `brew install sdl2_image`
- Reinstall: `brew reinstall sdl2_image`
- Upgrade: `brew upgrade sdl2_image`
- Locate the include folder: Best bet is doing a reinstall and finding the path from the output.
- Tree: run `tree` to see if it is linked to in the current folder.

### SDL2

- Check: `pkg-config --libs sdl2`
- Example: `-L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2`
- Install: `brew install sdl2`
- Reinstall: `brew reinstall sdl2`
- Upgrade: `brew upgrade sdl2`
- Locate the include folder: Best bet is doing a reinstall and finding the path from the output.
- Tree: run `tree` to see if it is linked to in the current folder.

### SDL_tff

- Check: `pkg-config --libs sdl2_ttf`
- Example: `-L/opt/homebrew/lib -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2`
- Install: `brew install sdl2_ttf`
- Reinstall: `brew reinstall sdl2_ttf`
- Upgrade: `brew upgrade sdl2_ttf`
- Locate the include folder: Best bet is doing a reinstall and finding the path from the output, in our case it said `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15`, so we looked in the folders downstream of this path (`ls /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15`)
- include Symlink Example: `ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/include/SDL2 include/SDL_ttf`
- lib Symlink Example: `ln -s /opt/homebrew/Cellar/sdl2_ttf/2.0.15/lib lib/SDL2_ttf`
- Tree: run `tree` to see if it is linked to in the current folder.
